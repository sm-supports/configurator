# Shape Auto-Select Fix

## Problem Statement

When adding a shape using the "Add [ShapeType]" button, the shape would be created on the canvas but **without transformation handles visible**. This made it difficult for users to:
- Position the newly created shape
- Resize the shape immediately
- Know that the shape was successfully added
- Begin manipulating the shape right away

**Expected Behavior:** Shape should be automatically selected with transformation handles visible after creation.

**Actual Behavior:** Shape appeared on canvas without selection handles.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a conflicting state update sequence:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **User clicks "Add Rectangle" button** in shape toolbar
2. **`addShape()` is called** in `useElementManipulation.ts`
   - Creates new shape element
   - Sets `selectedId: newShape.id` ✅ (shape is selected)
3. **`setActiveTool('select')` is called** in Toolbar.tsx
   - Changes active tool to 'select'
   - **But also sets `selectedId: null`** ❌ (deselects shape!)

### The Problematic Code Flow

**In Toolbar.tsx (line 1353):**
```tsx
onClick={() => {
  addShape(state.shapeSettings.shapeType);
  setActiveTool('select'); // ❌ This deselects the shape!
}}
```

**In useElementManipulation.ts (line 226):**
```tsx
const setActiveTool = useCallback((tool: ToolType) => {
  setState(prev => ({ 
    ...prev, 
    activeTool: tool, 
    selectedId: null  // ❌ Always clears selection!
  }));
}, [setState]);
```

**In useElementManipulation.ts (line 429):**
```tsx
setState(prev => {
  pushHistory(prev);
  return {
    ...prev,
    elements: [...prev.elements, newShape],
    selectedId: newShape.id,  // ✅ Selects the shape
    shapeSettings: { ...prev.shapeSettings, shapeType: finalShapeType }
  };
});
```

### The Race Condition

Both `addShape` and `setActiveTool` update state, but React batches these updates. The final state depends on which update is processed last:

```
Initial State: { activeTool: 'shape', selectedId: null }
       ↓
addShape called → Sets selectedId: 'shape-123'
       ↓
setActiveTool('select') called → Sets selectedId: null
       ↓
Final State: { activeTool: 'select', selectedId: null } ❌
```

Result: The shape is created but not selected, so no transformation handles appear.

## Solution

Remove the `setActiveTool('select')` call after adding a shape. The shape doesn't need to deactivate the shape tool because:

1. **Shape is already selected** by `addShape()` with `selectedId: newShape.id`
2. **User can immediately manipulate** the shape with transformation handles
3. **Shape toolbar remains open** so user can add more shapes if needed
4. **User can click "X" button** to close toolbar when done

### Fixed Code

**In Toolbar.tsx:**
```tsx
onClick={() => {
  addShape(state.shapeSettings.shapeType);
  // Don't call setActiveTool here - shape is auto-selected in addShape
  // and we want to keep it selected to show transformation handles
}}
```

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. Immediate Visual Feedback
✅ Shape appears with transformation handles visible  
✅ Clear indication that shape was successfully added  
✅ Bounding box shows exact shape size and position

### 2. Instant Manipulation
✅ User can drag to reposition immediately  
✅ User can resize using corner handles  
✅ User can rotate using rotation handle  
✅ No extra click needed to select shape

### 3. Better Workflow
✅ Create → Position → Resize → Done (smooth flow)  
❌ ~~Create → Click to select → Position → Resize → Done~~ (old flow)

### 4. Consistent with Other Tools
✅ **Text Tool:** Adds text with it selected  
✅ **Image Tool:** Adds image with it selected  
✅ **Shape Tool:** Now also selects after adding ✨

## User Experience Comparison

### Before Fix (Broken)
```
1. Click "Add Circle"
2. Circle appears (no handles) 😕
3. User confused - did it work?
4. User must click circle to select it
5. Handles appear
6. User can now position/resize
```

### After Fix (Working)
```
1. Click "Add Circle"
2. Circle appears WITH handles ✨
3. User immediately drags to position
4. User resizes to desired size
5. Done! 🎉
```

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `src/components/Editor/ui/panels/Toolbar.tsx`

### Change Made
**Line 1353-1354:** Removed `setActiveTool('select')` call

**Before:**
```tsx
onClick={() => {
  addShape(state.shapeSettings.shapeType);
  setActiveTool('select'); // ❌ Removed this line
}}
```

**After:**
```tsx
onClick={() => {
  addShape(state.shapeSettings.shapeType);
  // Don't call setActiveTool here - shape is auto-selected in addShape
  // and we want to keep it selected to show transformation handles
}}
```

### Why This Works

1. `addShape()` already handles selection correctly
2. No conflicting state update to clear `selectedId`
3. React processes the state update cleanly
4. Transformation handles render because `selectedId` matches shape ID

### Shape Toolbar Behavior

**After adding shape:**
- ✅ Shape toolbar **stays open**
- ✅ User can add multiple shapes in succession
- ✅ User can change shape settings between additions
- ✅ User can close toolbar with X button when done

**This is intentional and improves workflow:**
- Adding one shape often means adding more
- Keeping toolbar open reduces clicks
- User has explicit control via X button

## Testing

### Manual Test Cases

**Test 1: Add Single Shape**
- [x] Click Shape tool → toolbar opens
- [x] Select Rectangle
- [x] Click "Add Rectangle"
- [x] Rectangle appears at center
- [x] **Transformation handles visible** ✅
- [x] Can drag shape immediately
- [x] Can resize shape immediately
- [x] Can rotate shape immediately

**Test 2: Add Multiple Shapes**
- [x] Click Shape tool
- [x] Add Circle → circle selected with handles
- [x] Add Star → star selected with handles (circle deselected)
- [x] Add Triangle → triangle selected with handles (star deselected)
- [x] All three shapes on canvas
- [x] Last added shape is selected

**Test 3: Add and Configure**
- [x] Click Shape tool
- [x] Select Circle, Solid, Blue
- [x] Click "Add Circle" → blue circle with handles
- [x] Drag to top-left
- [x] Change to Rectangle, Outline, Red
- [x] Click "Add Rectangle" → red outline rectangle with handles
- [x] Both shapes properly configured

**Test 4: Shape Selection States**
- [x] Add shape → selected with handles
- [x] Click canvas → shape deselected
- [x] Click shape → selected again with handles
- [x] Click different shape → new shape selected, old deselected

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Rapid Shape Addition
**Scenario:** User clicks "Add Circle" multiple times quickly  
**Result:** Each circle is created and selected in sequence  
**Status:** ✅ Works correctly

### Case 2: Shape Added Off-Screen
**Scenario:** Canvas is zoomed/panned, shape might appear outside view  
**Result:** Shape still selected with handles (visible when panned)  
**Status:** ✅ Works correctly

### Case 3: Shape Overlaps Existing Elements
**Scenario:** New shape appears on top of text/images  
**Result:** New shape selected, old elements deselected  
**Status:** ✅ Works correctly

### Case 4: Close Toolbar After Adding
**Scenario:** Add shape, then click X to close toolbar  
**Result:** Shape remains selected with handles, toolbar closes  
**Status:** ✅ Works correctly

## Related Behavior

### Other Element Types

**Text Elements:**
```tsx
// In addText() - line 63
setState(prev => {
  pushHistory(prev);
  return {
    ...prev,
    elements: [...prev.elements, newText],
    selectedId: newText.id  // ✅ Auto-selected
  };
});
```

**Image Elements:**
```tsx
// In addImage() - line 123
setState(prev => {
  pushHistory(prev);
  return {
    ...prev,
    elements: [...prev.elements, newImage],
    selectedId: newImage.id  // ✅ Auto-selected
  };
});
```

**Shape Elements:**
```tsx
// In addShape() - line 429
setState(prev => {
  pushHistory(prev);
  return {
    ...prev,
    elements: [...prev.elements, newShape],
    selectedId: newShape.id  // ✅ Auto-selected (now works!)
  };
});
```

All element types now have **consistent auto-selection behavior** ✨

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Modify setActiveTool (Not Chosen)
Make `setActiveTool` preserve selection:
```tsx
const setActiveTool = useCallback((tool: ToolType) => {
  setState(prev => ({ 
    ...prev, 
    activeTool: tool 
    // Don't clear selectedId
  }));
}, [setState]);
```

**Rejected because:**
- Changes behavior of other tools (paint, brush, etc.)
- Those tools explicitly want to clear selection
- Would require conditionals for different tool types
- More complex and error-prone

### Option 2: Pass flag to setActiveTool (Not Chosen)
```tsx
const setActiveTool = useCallback((tool: ToolType, keepSelection = false) => {
  setState(prev => ({ 
    ...prev, 
    activeTool: tool,
    selectedId: keepSelection ? prev.selectedId : null
  }));
}, [setState]);
```

**Rejected because:**
- Over-engineering for this specific issue
- Adds complexity to function signature
- Not needed if we just remove the call

### Option 3: Remove setActiveTool Call (Chosen) ✅
Simply don't call `setActiveTool('select')` after adding shape.

**Chosen because:**
- Simplest solution
- No side effects on other code
- Shape already selected by `addShape()`
- Toolbar staying open is actually beneficial
- User has X button for explicit control

## Documentation Updates
