# Shape Toolbar Button Fix

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Shapes Not Being Generated to Canvas**
When clicking shape toolbar buttons (rectangle, circle, triangle, etc.), no shapes appeared on the canvas.

**Root Cause:**
The toolbar was calling `setShapeSettings()` followed by `addShape()` in sequence:
```tsx
onClick={() => {
  setShapeSettings({ shapeType: 'rectangle' });  // Updates state asynchronously
  addShape();  // Executes immediately with OLD state
}}
```

Because React state updates are asynchronous, when `addShape()` executed, it still read the OLD `state.shapeSettings.shapeType`, not the newly set one. This caused shapes to be created with the wrong type (or not at all if the initial state didn't have a valid shape type).

### 2. **Shape Buttons Stayed "Selected" (Active State)**
Shape toolbar buttons had visual highlighting that made them appear selected/active after clicking.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Modified `addShape()` to Accept Shape Type Parameter**

Changed the function signature to accept an optional `shapeType` parameter that gets used immediately (synchronously).

### 2. **Updated Toolbar Buttons to Single-Click Actions**

- Removed conditional styling based on `state.shapeSettings.shapeType`
- Direct call to `addShape()` with shape type parameter
- Consistent hover effect without active/selected state
- Updated titles from "Rectangle" to "Add Rectangle" for clarity

### 3. **Updated Interface Definition**

Added optional parameter to `addShape` function signature in Toolbar props.

## Behavior Changes

### Before Fix:
1. Click "Rectangle" button → Settings update → Shape created with OLD type (wrong or none)
2. Button stays highlighted as "selected"
3. User confused why shapes aren't appearing

### After Fix:
1. Click "Add Rectangle" button → Shape immediately created with correct type
2. Button returns to normal state (no persistent highlight)
3. Shape appears on canvas, selected and ready to edit
4. Visual feedback through hover effect only
