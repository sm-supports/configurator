# Paint Brush Auto-Deselect on Text Interaction

## Problem
When users were in paint brush mode (brush, airbrush, spray, or eraser) and they:
1. Added a new text element, OR
2. Selected a text element from the layers panel

The paint tool would remain active, which could be confusing since they were now working with text.

## Solution
Modified the `useElementManipulation` hook to automatically switch from paint tools to the 'select' tool when interacting with text elements.

## Files Modified

### `/src/components/Editor/hooks/useElementManipulation.ts`

#### 1. Modified `addText()` function (Lines 21-59)
**Added automatic paint tool deactivation when creating text:**

```typescript
setState(prev => {
  pushHistory(prev);
  return {
    ...prev,
    elements: [...prev.elements, newText],
    selectedId: newText.id,
    // Deselect paint brush when adding text
    activeTool: ['brush', 'airbrush', 'spray', 'eraser'].includes(prev.activeTool) ? 'select' : prev.activeTool
  };
});
```

#### 2. Modified `selectElement()` function (Lines 123-138)
**Added smart detection to deactivate paint tools when selecting text elements:**

```typescript
const selectElement = useCallback((id: string) => {
  setState(prev => {
    // Find the element being selected
    const element = prev.elements.find(el => el.id === id);
    const isTextElement = element?.type === 'text';
    
    // If selecting text element and paint brush is active, deselect paint brush
    const shouldDeactivatePaint = isTextElement && ['brush', 'airbrush', 'spray', 'eraser'].includes(prev.activeTool);
    
    return {
      ...prev,
      selectedId: id,
      activeTool: shouldDeactivatePaint ? 'select' : prev.activeTool
    };
  });
}, [setState]);
```

## User Experience Flow

### Before Fix
```
User in paint brush mode
  ↓
Clicks "Add Text" button
  ↓
Text is added BUT brush still active ❌
User confused about mode
```

```
User in paint brush mode
  ↓
Clicks text element in layers panel
  ↓
Text is selected BUT brush still active ❌
Can't edit text properly
```

### After Fix
```
User in paint brush mode
  ↓
Clicks "Add Text" button
  ↓
Text is added AND tool switches to 'select' ✅
Clear that user is now in text editing mode
```

```
User in paint brush mode
  ↓
Clicks text element in layers panel
  ↓
Text is selected AND tool switches to 'select' ✅
Ready to edit text immediately
```

## What About Other Element Types?

The fix is **text-specific** by design:
- ✅ **Text elements** → Auto-deselect paint tool
- ⏭️ **Image elements** → Keep paint tool active (might want to paint over images)
- ⏭️ **Paint elements** → Keep paint tool active (might want to erase/modify)

This provides the most intuitive workflow for users.

## Paint Tools Affected

This behavior applies to all paint tools:
- 🖌️ **Brush** → Auto-switches to 'select' when working with text
- 💨 **Airbrush** → Auto-switches to 'select' when working with text
- 🎨 **Spray** → Auto-switches to 'select' when working with text
- 🧹 **Eraser** → Auto-switches to 'select' when working with text

## Testing Checklist

To verify this feature works correctly:

- [x] ✅ Select brush tool → Click "Add Text" → Tool switches to 'select'
- [x] ✅ Select airbrush tool → Click "Add Text" → Tool switches to 'select'
- [x] ✅ Select spray tool → Click "Add Text" → Tool switches to 'select'
- [x] ✅ Select eraser tool → Click "Add Text" → Tool switches to 'select'
- [x] ✅ Select brush tool → Click text in layers panel → Tool switches to 'select'
- [x] ✅ Select brush tool → Click image in layers panel → Tool stays as brush
- [x] ✅ Select brush tool → Click paint stroke in layers panel → Tool stays as brush
- [x] ✅ Not in paint mode → Click "Add Text" → Tool stays unchanged
- [x] ✅ Not in paint mode → Select text from layers → Tool stays unchanged

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Context**: Users immediately know they're in text editing mode
2. **Prevents Confusion**: No mixed mode states where paint tool is active but text is selected
3. **Better Workflow**: Seamless transition from painting to text editing
4. **Intuitive**: Matches user expectations about tool behavior
5. **Smart Detection**: Only affects text elements, not images or paint strokes

## Implementation Details

- Uses array `.includes()` to check for paint tools: `['brush', 'airbrush', 'spray', 'eraser']`
- Switches to `'select'` tool when deactivating paint tools
- Preserves tool state when not a paint tool
- Type-safe element checking using `element?.type === 'text'`
- Works with both direct "Add Text" button and layers panel selection
