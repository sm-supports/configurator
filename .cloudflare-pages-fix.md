# üö® Cloudflare Pages Deployment Issue - FIX REQUIRED

## Problem
Cloudflare Pages is deploying commit `0d4d97d` instead of the latest commit `5397573`.

This old commit does NOT have the `pages:build` script, causing the build to fail.

## Root Cause
Your Cloudflare Pages project is configured to deploy a **specific commit hash** instead of tracking the **branch**.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION - Do This Now:

### In Cloudflare Dashboard:

1. **Go to:** Workers & Pages ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Builds & deployments

2. **Look for:** "Production branch" or "Build configuration"

3. **Find this setting and CHANGE IT:**
   - ‚ùå If it says: `0d4d97d133836e84f26c3a624226833c5b6506cc` (commit hash)
   - ‚úÖ Change to: `main` (branch name)

4. **Click "Save"**

5. **Then:** Go to Deployments ‚Üí Click "Retry deployment"

## Alternative: Delete and Recreate

If you can't find the setting above:

### Step 1: Delete Current Project
1. Go to: Workers & Pages ‚Üí Your Project
2. Click: Settings ‚Üí Danger Zone
3. Click: "Delete project"

### Step 2: Create New Project
1. Click: "Create Application" ‚Üí "Pages" ‚Üí "Connect to Git"
2. Select: `sm-supports/configurator` repository
3. **IMPORTANT:** Select **branch `main`** (not a commit hash!)
4. Configure:
   ```
   Framework preset: Next.js
   Build command: npm run pages:build
   Build output directory: .open-next/assets
   Root directory: / (leave empty)
   ```
5. Add environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `NODE_VERSION` = `20.12.0`
6. Click: "Save and Deploy"

## Verify It's Fixed

After redeploying, check the build log. It should show:
```
HEAD is now at 5397573 Trigger Cloudflare Pages rebuild with latest changes
```

NOT:
```
HEAD is now at 0d4d97d chore: Trigger Vercel rebuild with latest fixes
```

---

## If Still Having Issues

The problem is 100% in your Cloudflare Pages configuration, not in the code.

The code is correct and ready to deploy. You just need Cloudflare to use the latest commit from the `main` branch.
