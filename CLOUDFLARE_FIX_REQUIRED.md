# URGENT: Cloudflare Pages Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Your deployment is failing because `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag is NOT being applied by Cloudflare Pages, even though it's configured in `wrangler.json`.

## THE ONLY WORKING SOLUTION

You **MUST** configure this in the **Cloudflare Pages Dashboard**. Config files are ignored by Cloudflare Pages during deployment.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Log into Cloudflare Dashboard**: https://dash.cloudflare.com

2. **Navigate to Pages**:
   - Click "Workers & Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Click on your project name (configurator)

3. **Go to Settings**:
   - Click the "Settings" tab at the top

4. **Configure Compatibility**:
   - Scroll down to "Functions" section
   - Click "Compatibility flags" 
   - Under "Compatibility flags", click "+ Add flag"
   - Type: `nodejs_compat`
   - Click "Save"

5. **Set Compatibility Date**:
   - In the same section, set "Compatibility date" to: `2025-03-25`
   - Click "Save"

6. **Trigger New Deployment**:
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Retry deployment" on the latest failed deployment
   OR
   - Push any commit to trigger automatic deployment

## Screenshot of Where to Find It

Look for this in your Cloudflare Dashboard:

```
Settings > Functions > Compatibility flags
[+ Add flag] button
Compatibility date: [2025-03-25]
```

## Why Config Files Don't Work

- `wrangler.json` - Only works for `wrangler deploy`, NOT Cloudflare Pages Git integration
- `wrangler.toml` - Only works for `wrangler deploy`, NOT Cloudflare Pages Git integration  
- `open-next.config.ts` - Doesn't support compatibility flags
- Environment variables - Not supported for compatibility flags

## After Configuring

Once you've added `nodejs_compat` in the dashboard:
1. Your next deployment will succeed
2. All Node.js built-in modules will work
3. No code changes needed

## Verification

After setting this up, the build logs should NOT show these errors anymore:
- ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "async_hooks"
- ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "fs"
- ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "path"
- etc.

## If You Don't Have Dashboard Access

If you don't have access to the Cloudflare dashboard, you need to:
1. Ask the account owner to add the compatibility flag
2. OR, switch to deploying via `wrangler deploy` instead of Git integration

**This is the ONLY way to fix this issue with Cloudflare Pages Git deployments.**
