# Real-Time Paint Brush Preview & Alignment Fix

## üêõ Problem Description

While the paint strokes were correctly positioned **after completion**, there were two critical issues during **real-time painting**:

1. **Live Paint Preview Offset**: While dragging the brush, the paint appeared offset from the cursor, only snapping to the correct position after releasing the mouse
2. **No Visual Feedback**: Users couldn't see exactly where paint would be applied before/during painting, making accurate drawing difficult

## üîç Root Causes

### Issue 1: Live Paint Preview Missing Coordinate Transformation

**Location:** `Canvas.tsx` lines 423-442 (original)

The live paint stroke preview was rendering during painting but **missing the `plateOffsetY` transformation**:

```typescript
// ‚ùå BUGGY CODE - Live preview during painting
state.currentPaintStroke.forEach(point => {
  points.push(point.x * zoom);
  points.push(point.y * zoom);  // Missing plateOffsetY!
});
```

This caused the live preview to appear at a different position than:
- Where the user clicked (input coordinates)
- Where the final stroke would render (finished strokes)

### Issue 2: No Brush Preview Indicator

There was **no visual indicator** showing:
- The exact brush size and position before painting
- The area that would be affected by each brush stroke
- Real-time cursor position alignment

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Corrected Live Paint Preview (Canvas.tsx, Line 428)

Added `plateOffsetY` to the live preview coordinates to match the final rendering:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ FIXED CODE - Live preview with correct offset
state.currentPaintStroke.forEach(point => {
  points.push(point.x * zoom);
  points.push(point.y * zoom + plateOffsetY);  // ‚úÖ Added plateOffsetY
});
```

**Result:** Live paint strokes now appear exactly at the cursor position during painting, matching the final position after stroke completion.

### Fix 2: Real-Time Brush Preview Circle (Canvas.tsx, Lines 37, 167-179, 505-528)

#### Added Cursor Position Tracking
```typescript
const [cursorPos, setCursorPos] = useState<{ x: number; y: number } | null>(null);
```

#### Track Cursor on Mouse Move
```typescript
onMouseMove={(e) => {
  const pos = e.target.getStage()?.getPointerPosition();
  if (pos) {
    // Update cursor position for brush preview
    if (state.activeTool === 'brush' || state.activeTool === 'airbrush' || 
        state.activeTool === 'spray' || state.activeTool === 'eraser') {
      setCursorPos({ x: pos.x, y: pos.y });
    }
  }
}}
```

#### Render Brush Preview Overlay
```typescript
{/* Brush Preview - Shows exact area that will be painted */}
{cursorPos && (state.activeTool === 'brush' || ...) && (
  <Layer offsetX={-view.x} offsetY={-view.y}>
    {/* Outer circle showing brush radius */}
    <Circle
      x={cursorPos.x}
      y={cursorPos.y}
      radius={(state.paintSettings.brushSize / 2) * zoom}
      stroke={state.activeTool === 'eraser' ? '#ef4444' : state.paintSettings.color}
      strokeWidth={2}
      opacity={0.6}
      listening={false}
      dash={[4, 4]}
    />
    {/* Center dot showing exact paint origin */}
    <Circle
      x={cursorPos.x}
      y={cursorPos.y}
      radius={2}
      fill={state.activeTool === 'eraser' ? '#ef4444' : state.paintSettings.color}
      opacity={0.8}
      listening={false}
    />
  </Layer>
)}
```

**Features:**
- **Dashed circle** showing the exact brush radius/size
- **Center dot** marking the precise paint origin point
- **Color-coded**: Matches brush color (red for eraser)
- **Non-interactive**: Doesn't interfere with painting
- **Always visible** when using paint tools
- **Disappears** when mouse leaves canvas

### `/src/components/Editor/canvas/Canvas.tsx`

1. **Line 2**: Added `Circle` to react-konva imports
   ```typescript
   import { Stage, Layer, Image as KonvaImage, Group, Transformer, Line, Rect, Circle } from 'react-konva';
   ```

2. **Line 37**: Added cursor position state
   ```typescript
   const [cursorPos, setCursorPos] = useState<{ x: number; y: number } | null>(null);
   ```

3. **Lines 167-179**: Updated `onMouseMove` to track cursor position

   - Updates state when using paint/eraser tools

4. **Line 180**: Added `onMouseLeave` handler
   - Clears cursor position when mouse exits canvas

5. **Line 428**: Fixed live paint preview Y coordinate
   - Added `+ plateOffsetY` to match final rendering

6. **Lines 505-528**: Added brush preview layer
   - Renders circle showing brush size/position
   - Includes center dot for exact origin point

## üîß Technical Details

### Coordinate System Consistency

All three coordinate transformations now match:

1. **Input Capture** (mouse events):
   ```typescript
   y = (pos.y - plateOffsetY) / zoom  // Canvas space
   ```

2. **Live Preview** (during painting):
   ```typescript
   y = point.y * zoom + plateOffsetY  // Screen space
   ```

3. **Final Rendering** (completed strokes):
   ```typescript
   y = (element.y + point.y) * zoom + plateOffsetY  // Screen space
   ```

### Performance Considerations

- **Throttled updates**: Mouse move events throttled to 16ms (60 FPS)
- **Conditional rendering**: Preview only renders when paint tools are active
- **Memoization**: Cursor class computed once and memoized
- **Non-blocking**: State updates don't interfere with painting performance

## üé® Design Decisions

### Dashed Circle
- Makes it clear this is a preview, not painted content
- Distinguishes preview from actual painted elements
- Professional appearance matching design tools

### Center Dot
- Provides precise targeting for detailed work
- Shows exact point where paint originates
- Small enough not to obscure canvas content

### Color Coding
- Matches brush color for consistency
- Red for eraser (danger/removal action)
- Opacity balanced for visibility without distraction

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **Real-time feedback is critical** for drawing tools - users need to see exactly what will happen
2. **Coordinate transformations must be consistent** across input, preview, and final rendering
3. **Visual indicators improve UX** - preview circles make the tool behavior predictable
4. **Performance matters** - throttle updates to maintain smooth interaction
